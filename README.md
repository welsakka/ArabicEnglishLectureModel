# ArabicEnglishLectureModel
A project aimed at accurately transcribing Arabic and English Speech into English only text. The Whisper model is fine-tuned on audio samples containing both Arabic and English speech. Scripts included in this project are written to run on Google Colab.

The inspiration for this project came for a need to caption Islamic lecturers who often switch between the two languages in their speeches. Audio samples may include Quranic recitation, snippits from online lectures from popular imams. 

Arabic Transliteration to English text follows the scheme described in Arabic Through the Quran by Alan Jones: https://corpus.quran.com/documentation/phonetic.jsp
